# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Analysis (Zomato Dataset)

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing restaurant data from Zomato, with the aim of uncovering trends and patterns that influence customer ratings.

From cleaning messy real-world data to generating meaningful visualizations, this project reflects my growing skills in **Data Analytics**, **Python**, and **storytelling with data**.
